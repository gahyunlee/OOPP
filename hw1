Q1: Assuming there are no delays or accidents, the distance that a car travels down the interstate
can be calculated with the following formula
Distance = Speed x Time
Write a program to ask the user to enter the speed of her car. Then the program should
display the distance travelled by the car in 5 hours, 8 hours and 12 hours.
'''
speed = int (input('Please enter the speed of your car: '))
print('The distance the car will travel in 5 hours is', 5*speed)
print('The distance the car will travel in 8 hours is', 8*speed)
print('The distance the car will travel in 12 hours is', 12*speed)


'''
Q2: Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer, n, that is less than 10. If the
user enters a negative number or a number greater than 9, the program should display a
message and stop. Otherwise the program should print the sum of n +nn + nnn
'''
n = int(input('Please enter a positive integer that is less than 10: '))
if (n < 0 or n > 9):
    print('Invalid input.')
else: 
    print (n + n*11 + n*111)

Q3: Write a Python program that asks the user to enter the following information
• His or her name
• His or her age
• The name of a city
